Your pull request looks great

Now it's time to tell us what‚Äôs the font you choose

Point-three seconds to my first contentful paint  
GitHub stars feel very different today  
For here  
Am I copying solutions  
From Stack Overflow  
And there‚Äôs nothing I can do

## Local Development

### Frontend

The frontend is a Next site. Environment variable are set in Netlify, so work with Netlify Dev for easier local development.

#### Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Netlify CLI](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/#installation)

#### Installation

1. Install Node.
1. Clone the repo.
    ```sh
    git clone git@github.com:netlify/explorers.git
    cd explorers/
    ```
1. Install project packages.
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

#### Configuration

Add the following environment variable to a `.env` file at the project root:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_GRAPHQL_URL=https://q8efilev.api.sanity.io/v1/graphql/production/default
```

This is a read-only GraphQL API to pull Jamstack Explorers missions, stages, and other data.

#### Usage

Start the server for local development:

```sh
npm run dev
```

The browser will open at `http://localhost:8888`.

### OAuth

Right now the OAuth is set up to run through the production site, so you _do not_ need to set up local OAuth.

If you want to try it out, you can [create a new OAuth app](https://app.netlify.com/user/applications) with a redirect URL of `http://localhost:8888/.netlify/functions/auth-callback` to allow local OAuth flows and testing.

See `.env.EXAMPLE` for the required env vars.

### Sanity

See [the backend README](/backend/README.md) for details on the Sanity setup for this project.

### Code Formatting With Prettier

We have a prettier pre-commit hook. To run formatting on the command line:

```sh
npm run format
```

### Certificate Generation

Certificate generation is managed through a [private repo](https://github.com/sdras/az-certificate). If you‚Äôre a project maintainer, you‚Äôll need an invite to view it.
