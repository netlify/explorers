## Local Development

### Front-End

The frontend is a Next site. Env vars are in Netlify, so work with Netlify Dev for easier local development.

#### Prerequisites

- [Netlify CLI](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/#installation)

#### Instructions

```bash
# clone the repo
git clone git@github.com:netlify/explorers.git

# move into the new project
cd explorers/

# install dependencies
npm install
```

Add the following env vars to `.env` at the project root:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_GRAPHQL_URL=https://q8efilev.api.sanity.io/v1/graphql/production/default
```

This is a read-only GraphQL API to pull Jamstack Explorers missions, stages, and other data.

Start the site locally:

```sh
# start the site for local development
npm run dev
```

The site will open at `http://localhost:8888`.

### OAuth

Right now the OAuth is set up to run through the production site, so you _do not_ need to set up local OAuth.

If you want to try it out, you can [create a new OAuth app](https://app.netlify.com/user/applications) with a redirect URL of `http://localhost:8888/.netlify/functions/auth-callback` to allow local OAuth flows and testing.

See `.env.EXAMPLE` for the required env vars.

### Sanity

See [the backend README](./backend/README.md) for details on the Sanity setup for this project.

### Code Formatting With Prettier

We have a prettier pre-commit hook. To run formatting on the command line:

```sh
npm run format
```

### Certificate Generation

Certificate generation is managed through a [private repo](https://github.com/sdras/az-certificate). If you’re a project maintainer, you’ll need an invite to view it.
