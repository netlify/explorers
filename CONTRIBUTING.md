# How to Contribute

First and foremost: **we love community contributions!** Thanks for reading this and pitching in to make Jamstack Explorers even better!

## What we’d love to have you contribute

1. Bug fixes — [check out our issues list!](https://github.com/netlify/explorers/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3A%22type%3A+bug%22)
2. Missions (soon!) — [see the notes on contributing mission](#how-to-contribute-content)

## What we’re _not_ looking for

1. Opinions — our mission authors put _a lot_ of time and effort into their missions, and we don’t want to nitpick them on why they chose to do things the way they did them. If you have differing opinions, don’t nitpick someone else’s work — create your own mission!
2. Design changes — to keep this site from scope creeping, we’re currently routing all design through the Netlify team. If you’ve got design ideas, we’re excited to see them [opened as issues](https://github.com/netlify/explorers/issues), though!

## How to contribute a mission

We're _really_ excited to have you contribute a lesson to Jamstack Explorers! We're still working out the details of this, though, so we're not quite ready to take submissions.

If you're interested, please [drop us a line](mailto:devexperience@netlify.com).

## How to name your branches

- We use the following branch convention:

  ```
  // Structure
  <initials>/<issue #>/<title of issue>

  // Example
  sd/2/cool-feature
  tzm/13/fixesThing
  ```

- Everything needs to be a pull request — no direct commits to `main`
- PRs are merged with squash merges only and use [conventional commits](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli#if-your-repo-is-commitizen-friendly) for easier changelog generation
- All PRs need to be approved by one of the CODEOWNERS
